 * NIO is built on two foundational items; buffers and channels
 * buffer: holds data. 
 * channel: represents an open connection to an I/O device such as a file or a socket
 * 
 * Path interface: encapsulates a path to a file. describes a file's location within the directory structure - e.g., exuectuabe, readOnly, hidden? etc.
